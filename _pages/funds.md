K9 Campout is now proudly operated by **[Undefined](http://undefined.charity)**, a registered non-profit organization committed to transparency and community service. As a non-profit, we operate with full financial transparency and accountability to our community.

## Our Commitment

As a registered non-profit organization, Undefined ensures that:
- All funds are used solely for event operations and community benefit
- Complete financial transparency is maintained
- No individual profits from the event
- Costs are kept as low as possible while providing an exceptional experience
- Financial records are publicly available and regularly updated

## Community Support

None of this would be possible without the additional support and generosity of individuals and groups in our community - particularly TRC Semi-Permanent sites who host us, our sponsors, and volunteers who donate their time and resources. Our heartfelt thanks and gratitude goes to all parties that help make this event possible.
