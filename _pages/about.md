Do you miss the days of camping with pups in years gone by? Well, we are here to make it a thing again.

K9 Campout is now proudly operated by **[Undefined](http://undefined.charity)**, a registered non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and fostering community events. Our mission is to bring together like-minded pups and handlers for an unforgettable camping experience in the forest.

This is a private event hosted at CampTRC and is not affiliated with any PAH organization. As a non-profit, we are committed to keeping costs low, maintaining financial transparency, and ensuring all proceeds benefit the community and event experience.
