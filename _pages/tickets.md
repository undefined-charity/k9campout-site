# Important - How to book!

**1.** Have you ever camped at Camp TRC Before?

If not, please go here: [https://camptrc.org/Join](https://camptrc.org/Join) and get a limited membership - it's Free! - but of course you could become a regular member of the campground and support the amazing TRC community if you wish.

**2.** If you have camped before (or just signed up), please go to [https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile](https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile)

On this page you will see your membership level - **take note! - it will say "Limited Membership - Free", or "Regular Membership"**, and a little further down it will say **User ID, again, take note! - you need this number.**

**3.** On the same page,  it will say **Renewal due on** - make sure this date is after August 15, 2025. There might be a button there to renew if you are due; please renew if you are due; even Free membership needs to be renewed

**4.** If you have someone else staying in your tent, add the "Existing Tent" ticket type for each additional person (or have them place an order selecting "Existing Tent" - and provide your site number during checkout). TRC Charges per person, not per campsite. Everyone needs a camping arrangement (Camping with the pack, existing booking or a booking/arrangement directly with TRC).

**5.** Please note, that after checkout, you will not be able to change your Tag Name, or TRC member details. We will reach out to everyone ~60days before the event to provide update a method to update these.

**With this information you are ready to book! Please click "Get Tickets".**


## Notes
This year (like last), TRC is not doing reserved tent sites (its first come first served, outside of group bookings). Camping with the pack will get you a reserved tent site, alongside other attendees. This year you can select your own tent site!

- Camping with the pack tickets include all camping costs
- BYO Event tickets require you have another camping arrangement with TRC (RV, Seasonal Site, First Come Tent Site ect)
