Follow these steps to register with TRC, then get your tickets!

## Step 1: Get Your TRC Membership Info

### New to TRC? 
Sign up here: **[https://camptrc.org/Join](https://camptrc.org/Join)**

You'll need a limited membership to camp (it's FREE!). If you want to support TRC year-round, you're also welcome to become a regular member and join the amazing TRC community!

### Already signed up? 
Log in to TRC here: **[https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile](https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile)**

Make sure your membership is active through at least **August 15, 2025**. If it isn't, renew it‚Äîeven Free memberships need to be up to date.

Once logged in, **take note of the following:**
- **Your membership level:** It should say "Limited Membership - Free" or "Regular Membership"
- **Your User ID:** You'll need this number for your ticket purchase

## Step 2: Choose Your Camping Option

### üèïÔ∏è Camping with the Pack (Group Camping)
- Get a reserved tent site alongside other attendees
- All camping costs included
- You can select your own tent site during booking
- **Currently SOLD OUT** (see notice below)

### üöê BYO Camping (Bring Your Own Arrangement)
- For those with their own camping arrangement through TRC
- Includes: RV sites, seasonal sites, first-come tent sites, or existing tent arrangements

## Step 3: Special Situations

### Sharing a Tent?
If someone is staying in **your** tent **and you have a "Camping with the Pack" booking**, they should select the **"Existing Tent"** ticket type when ordering. Make sure to include your site number during checkout.

**Important:** TRC charges per person, not per campsite, so everyone needs their own camping arrangement‚Äîeither through this event, a direct booking with TRC, or by joining an existing tent.

### Looking for RV Spots?
Book your RV site directly through TRC and choose the **BYO camping** ticket option.
**TRC RV Booking:** [https://www.camptrc.org/RV-Reservations-(NEW!)](https://www.camptrc.org/RV-Reservations-(NEW!))

### Final Notes
- Charges will appear under the non-profit organization "undefined" - this is not a technical glitch!
- After checkout, you won't be able to change your tag name or TRC member details
- We'll reach out to everyone about 30 days before the event to provide a way to update that info
