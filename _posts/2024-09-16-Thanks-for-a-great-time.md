We want to thank everyone that attended K9 Campout and to those who took their time to volunteer and make all this possible! We had over 120 pups and people eager to howl with us! We are delighted to say that we sold out all TRC camping sites resulting with folks occupying overflow. We look forward to seeing everyone next year for a magnificent and mischievous weekend.
