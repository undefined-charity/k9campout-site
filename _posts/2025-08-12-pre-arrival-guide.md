We're just about ready to wag our tails — K9 Campout is almost here! To make your arrival smooth and stress-free, here's everything you need to know before you head out next weekend.

## 🎟 Tickets & At-the-Door Sales

Online ticket sales are now closed, but we do have a little extra space for last-minute pups. If you have a friend who wants to join, they'll need to book camping directly with TRC first at [https://camptrc.org/event-6061750](https://camptrc.org/event-6061750). Once they've got their camping sorted, it'll be $50 at the door — cash or card is fine.

## 🐾 We Still Need Helping Paws

We could use a few more hands (and paws!) for Meet & Greet, Setup, and Pup Games. If you have some capacity, please sign up at [http://woofy.link/helpingpaws](http://woofy.link/helpingpaws). Volunteers get automatic entry into the K9 Campout Volunteer Prize Draw and exclusive Early Bird ticket discounts for next year — the more shifts you help with, the bigger the discount.

## 🛠 What to Bring & Weather

You can check the full list of suggested items here: [https://camptrc.org/What-to-Bring](https://camptrc.org/What-to-Bring). Right now, the forecast is calling for rain Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, though it's changing constantly. Remember to pack rain gear, your tent rain fly or a tarp, and be ready for things to get a little muddy.

All event areas are covered, and every campsite area has a tarped fire pit, so you'll be able to stay warm and dry no matter what the weather does.

## 🚗 Parking & Unloading

There's a lot of people coming this year, so we'll need everyone to unpack quickly at the lower campground, then move their vehicles up to the upper camping area for parking. It could be up to a 10-minute walk from the upper lot back down to the lower campground. To help, there are wheelbarrows at the lower campground so you can move your gear from your car to your campsite. Bear rules still apply ([https://camptrc.org/Bear-Info](https://camptrc.org/Bear-Info)) — we have whistles for everyone, but please make sure all food and scented items are stored properly.

## 🏕 Campsites

Sites 1–7 are reserved for named attendees in our group. If you have a BYO camping ticket, please find a site in 8 or above, or in the overflow areas. If those fill up, we may place folks in between existing sites or up in the upper campground. Please don't assume an empty spot in Sites 1–7 is available — the Meet & Greet Puppies will be on hand to help you find your space.

## 📋 Check-In Process

When you arrive, check in first at the Lower Campground Host Hut. TRC will confirm your ID and booking. If you have a "Camping with the Pack" booking, TRC should have already emailed you a check-in code — having this ready will help speed things along.

After that, unpack, move your vehicle, and get comfortable at your campsite. Once you're set up, come up to Junkyard Dogs and we'll get you your lanyard, tags, and other goodies.

## 🆔 IDs & Consent Stickers

We'll be enforcing event IDs a little more this year, so please wear your lanyard while attending any K9 Campout events. You can move your tag to something else if you prefer, but the colored lanyard is what we'll be looking for.

**Your lanyard — not your tag — is your ticket.**

Don't forget to bring your photo ID so TRC can check you in quickly.

We'll also have optional stickers to show your comfort level with touch: green for "OK to touch," yellow for "Ask first," and red for "Don't touch." Stickers are completely voluntary, but remember — no always means no, regardless of sticker color. If someone doesn't have a sticker or you can't see it, please ask before touching.

More details are here: [https://undefined.charity/terms/](https://undefined.charity/terms/).

## 📸 Photos & Privacy

We'll be taking some photos during the event. The photo terms at [https://undefined.charity/terms/](https://undefined.charity/terms/) apply inside our events. If you don't want your photo taken or used on social media, we'll have red wristbands available. Please note that if you're wearing one, you should avoid joining group photos since it's not always possible to remove people afterward. We'll always do our best to ask before taking a picture, but sometimes photobombs happen.

That's a lot of info, but it'll make things run smoothly so we can all get to the fun faster. We can't wait to see you next weekend — bring your gear, your good vibes, and your pup pride. 🐕💥

See you soon,  
The K9 Campout Crew
