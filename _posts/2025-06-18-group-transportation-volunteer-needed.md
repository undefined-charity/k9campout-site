## Group Transportation Initiative

Based on community feedback and requests, we're excited to announce that we're exploring the possibility of organizing **group bus transportation** to K9 Campout 2025! This would provide an affordable, convenient, and environmentally friendly way for attendees to travel to Camp TRC together.

## We Need Your Help!

To make this happen, we're looking for dedicated community volunteers to help coordinate this transportation service. This is a great opportunity to contribute to making K9 Campout more accessible for everyone.

### What We Need:

**Transportation Coordinator(s)** to help with:
- Researching and contacting bus companies for quotes
- Comparing pricing and service options
- Coordinating pickup locations and schedules
- Managing reservations and logistics
- Serving as the main point of contact for transportation-related questions

### Ideal Volunteer Profile:

- Strong organizational and communication skills
- Comfortable making phone calls and negotiating with vendors
- Detail-oriented and reliable
- Bonus points if you've previously expressed interest in group transportation!

## Get Involved

If you're interested in helping coordinate group transportation for our community, or if you have connections with bus companies, please reach out to **@puproar** on our Telegram channel.

This is a volunteer position that would greatly benefit the entire K9 Campout community by:
- Reducing individual travel costs
- Creating a more sustainable transportation option
- Building community connections during travel
- Making the event more accessible to those without personal transportation

## Community Support

We believe in the power of our community working together to make K9 Campout the best experience possible for everyone. Whether you can volunteer to coordinate, have industry connections, or simply want to use the service once it's available, your support helps make this initiative successful.
