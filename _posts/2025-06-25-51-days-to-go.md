K9 Campout 2025 is just **51 days away** – happening August 15–17 at Camp TRC in Granite Falls, WA! 🏕🐾

Let's get everything ready so you and your pup have a smooth arrival!

## ✅ Action Needed

**Please check your Tag Name and Campsite** (if you're camping with the pack).

🔗 **[View the list and update info here](/2025/ticketed-puppies)**

We've got a few pups missing tag names or assigned campsites. If that's you, please use the form linked on that page to get us updated!

**Seriously do this!** Engraving takes time and we want to have the best tags possible for you this year!

## 🎟 Apple Wallet Tickets Now Available

You can now view or download your ticket via **"Manage Tickets"** at:

🔗 **[https://www.tickettailor.com/self-service/undefined](https://www.tickettailor.com/self-service/undefined)**

Perfect for quick, paperless check-in at the Host Hut or Junk Yard Dogs stations (or you can save the image to your phone still as well)!

## 🐶 A Few Reminders

- **Can't make it?** Refunds are self-service and available up to two weeks before the event.
- **Still need a ticket?** They're still available—and if you don't have a campsite yet, you can book a BYO Camping ticket and pay TRC directly for your camping. We'll make sure there's room for you, even if it means placing you in overflow camping 😉
- **Did you know?** K9 Campout is proudly hosted by [Undefined](https://undefined.charity), a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit in Washington State, dedicated to creating safe and welcoming spaces for the LGBTQIA+ community.

Thanks for helping us get everything dialed in before camp. We can't wait to see you (and your tails) out in the woods soon!
